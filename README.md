### 1. Mirage: Intro

The Elasticsearch query DSL supports 100+ query APIs ranging from full-text search, numeric range filters, geolocation queries to nested and span queries. 

Mirage is a modern, open-source web based query explorer for Elasticsearch. 

[![2-min Intro to Mirage](https://i.imgur.com/mBMBdfU.png)](https://vimeo.com/185000306)

It offers a blocks based GUI for composing Elasticsearch queries and comes with an on-the-fly transformer to show the corresponding JSON query API of Elasticsearch.

<br>

### 2. Features

* Mirage's GUI building blocks offer a smart way to creating queries. It uses the index's Elasticsearch mappings and the selected field's datatype to show only the applicable queries in the dropdown.

<br>

* Mirage provides two ways to add compound query clauses, 
  * `Add Conditions` allows adding additional clauses within the same query and  
  * `Nested Query` allows adding a nested query clause.

<br>

* Queries can be saved for later reuse. They can also be captured and shared by copying the URL.

* See docs for any query from within the app.

### 3. Roadmap

Mirage works with an Elasticsearch 2.x index currently. Below is the roadmap for query support.

✓ indicates queries already supported.  
➕ indicates queries we would like to support and see [contributions for](#5-how-to-contribute).  
❌ indicates queries that can't be supported currently.

| Full-text Queries      | Term Level Queries  | Joining Queries | Geo Queries          | Specialized Queries | Span Queries |
| :--------------------: |:-------------------:| :--------------:| :-------------------:|:-------------------:|:------------:|
| 	✓ Match               | 	✓ Term             | ➕ Nested       | ✓ GeoDistance         | ➕ MoreLikeThis     | ➕ SpanTerm   |
| 	✓ Multi-match         | 	✓ Terms            | ➕ HasChild     | ➕ GeoBoundingBox    | ➕ Template         | ➕ SpanMulti  |
| 	✓ Query String        | 	✓ Range            | ➕ HasParent    |  ➕ GeoShape       | ❌ Script           | ➕ SpanFirst  |
| 	✓ Simple Query String | 	✓ Exists           |                 | ➕ GeoDistanceRange  |                     | ➕ SpanNear   |
| 	✓ Common Terms        | 	✓ Missing          |                 | ➕ GeoPolygon        |                     | ➕ SpanOr     |
|                        | 	✓ Prefix           |                 | ➕ GeoHashCell       |                     | ➕ SpanNot    |
|                        | 	✓ Wildcard         |                 |                      |                     | ➕ SpanContaining   |
|                        | 	✓ Regexp           |                 |                      |                     | ➕ SpanWithin   |
|                        | 	✓ Fuzzy            |                 |                      |                     |
|                        | 	✓ Ids              |                 |                      |                     |
|                        | ❌ Type             |                 |                      |                     |

Besides broadening the query support, we would like to see Mirage support Elasticsearch v5.0.

<br>

### 4. Build Locally

```sh
$ npm install 
$ bower install
$ npm start
```

This will start a local webserver running on port 3030 serving mirage locally.

#### Tests

```sh
$ npm test
```

will fire up the jasmine tests. 

#### `master` branch: Elasticsearch Plugin

```sh
$ npm run build_es_plugin
```

#### `chrome-extension` branch: Chrome extension

```sh
$ npm run build_chrome_extension
```

<br>

### 5. How to Contribute  

1. Find a query that can be supported from the [roadmap](#3-roadmap).  
2. Fork the mirage repo and update in "dev" branch.
3. [Create the query files](https://github.com/appbaseio/mirage/blob/dev/HOW-TO-CONTRIBUTE.md).  
4. Build locally and run `npm test`.
5. Submit a PR!

<br>

### 6. Get Mirage

Mirage is available as a hosted app and as a chrome extension.

#### [Use hosted app](http://appbaseio.github.io/mirage)  

or  

#### [Get the Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mirage/dcnlpfmnpoggchflmdnkgiepijgljoka)

or

#### [appbase.io dashboard](https://appbase.io/scalr/apps)

Every app in appbase.io has a query explorer view, which uses mirage.

![Mirage Gif](https://uploads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/11609686/0425a4651aab31dde481fa6c/Mirage_Gif.gif)

or

#### Install as Elasticsearch Plugin

```sh
plugin install appbaseio/mirage
```

Note: To make sure you enable CORS settings for your ElasticSearch instance, add the following lines in the ES configuration file.
Alert: Elasticsearch has [CORS issue](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/20905) on Version 2.3.0
```
http.port: 9200
http.cors.allow-origin: "/.*/"
http.cors.enabled: true
http.cors.allow-headers : X-Requested-With,X-Auth-Token,Content-Type, Content-Length, Authorization
http.cors.allow-credentials: true
```

After installing the plugin, start the elasticsearch service and visit the following URL to access it.

http://127.0.0.1:9200/_plugin/mirage

``Note:`` If you use Elasticsearch from a different port, the URL to access and the http.cors.allow-origin value in the configuration file would change accordingly.

Mirage can be used along with ⊞ [DejaVu](https://github.com/appbaseio/dejaVu) to browse data and perform CRUD operations inside an Elasticsearch index.
